# Fake-News-Detector

Today we are living in the Era of information explosion. Along with the development of the Internet, the emergence and widespread adoption of the social media concept have changed the way news is formed and published. 

News has become faster, less costly and easily accessible with social media. This change has come along with some disadvantages as well. In particular, beguiling content, such as fake news made by social media users, is becoming increasingly dangerous. The fake news problem, despite being introduced for the first time very recently, has become an important research topic due to the high content of social media. Writing fake comments and news on social media is easy for users. The main challenge is to determine the difference between real and fake news.
